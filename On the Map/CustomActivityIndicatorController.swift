 An class that contains functions to display, and also disappear, the custom activity
 indicator from whichever view the functions are called from.
 
 Adds a UI overlay (gray tinted) that appears over the view and under the
 activity indicator. This makes the indicator more visible, and helps indicate to the user
 that they cannot interact with the view until the activity indicator disappears.
